# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**Yelp App** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **16** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search results page
- [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [x] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Filters Page with switches

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Why do constraints seem to break at times.
2. snippets for code reuse for xcode

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
